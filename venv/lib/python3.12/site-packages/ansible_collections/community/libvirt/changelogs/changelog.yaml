  1.0.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - added generic libvirt inventory plugin
      - removed libvirt_lxc inventory script
    fragments:
    - 23-inventory.yml
    release_date: '2020-08-18'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - libvirt_qemu - Mitigate a CPU hammering active wait loop
      - libvirt_qemu - add import error handling
      - virt - Correctly get the error message from libvirt
      - virt - Return "changed" status when using "define" command and domain XML
        was updated
      - virt - The define action searchs for the domain name into the xml definition
        to determine if the domain needs to be created or updated. The xml variable
        contains the parsed definition but doesn't guarantee the existence of the
        name tag. This change targets to fix the scenario where the xml var is not
        empty but doesn't contain a name tag.
      - virt_net - The name parameter is not required for the list_nets or facts command
        so we adjust the module to allow for that.

        or checkpoints_metadata (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.libvirt/issues/40).
      - virt_pool - replace discouraged function ``listAllVolumes`` with ``listAllVolumes``
        to fix potential race conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.libvirt/pull/135).
      - virt_pool - replace discouraged functions ``listStoragePools`` and ``listDefinedStoragePools``

      namespace: ''
    release_date: '2025-05-26'
  2.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - virt_volume - create_from was non-functional, and is now folded into create
        (added clone_source parameter). Fixes
      - virt_volume - info, facts, download, upload commands have been removed as
        they were not functional (and not tested).
      - virt_volume - wipe command now works (and is also a boolean option for 'state/absent'
        and 'command/delete').
      known_issues:
      - virt_volume - check_mode is disabled. It was not fully supported in the previous
        code either ('state/present', 'command/create' did not support it).
      major_changes:
      - virt_volume - a new command 'create_cidata_cdrom' enables the creation of
        a cloud-init CDROM, which can be attached to a cloud-init enabled base image,
        for bootstrapping networking, users etc.
      - virt_volume - the commands create_from, delete, download, info, resize, upload,
        wipe, facts did not work and were not tested. They have either been refactored
        to work, and tested, or removed.
      - virt_volume - the mechanism of passing variables to the member functions was
        not flexible enough to cope with differing parameter requirements. All parameters
        are now passed as kwargs, which allows the member functions to select the
        parameters they need.
      - virt_volume - the module appears to have been derived from virt_pool, but
        not cleaned up to remove much non-functional code.  It has been refactored
        to remove the pool-specific code, and to make it more flexible.

        This changelog contains all changes to the modules and plugins in this collection

        that have been made after the previous release.'
      removed_features:
      - virt_volume - PoolConnection class has been removed
      - virt_volume - the 'deleted' state has been removed as its definition was not
        entirely accurate, and the 'wipe' boolean option is added to 'state/absent'
        and 'command/delete'.
      - virt_volume - undocumented but unused FLAGS have been removed.
      - virt_volume - undocumented but unused/non-functional functions (get_status,
        get_status2, get_state, get_uuid, build) have been removed.
